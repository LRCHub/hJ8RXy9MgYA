```lrc
[00:10.84] Love flew away with
[00:14.29] No room to land and
[00:16.88] It made no mistake
[00:19.29] With no legs to stand on
[00:22.28] It grew its wings right in place
[00:25.20] We said goodbye one last time
[00:30.33] As love flew away
[00:38.83] 
[00:38.87] Looked in my eyes
[00:42.26] We only blinked when we started to cry
[00:47.36] Both barely dry
[00:49.91] When we finally realized that
[00:53.54] We should break the stare
[00:56.42] And try not to care as
[01:00.27] Love flew away
[01:07.27] 
[01:06.91] Maybe I'll find you in some other life
[01:12.65] We won't be heartbroken half of the time
[01:18.08] The ocean between us won't be so grand
[01:23.53] Tired after one more one-night stand
[01:30.29] But we really couldn't stay
[01:34.15] So we watched love fly away
[01:47.65] 
[01:41.96] Holding your hand
[01:45.41] Still feels electric
[01:48.08] I'd kiss you, but I can't
[01:50.67] We're all out of breath
[01:53.29] So we whisper among us
[01:56.11] For the last time today
[01:59.20] As our love flew away
[02:09.70] 
[02:10.22] We said goodbye
[02:13.09] As love flew away
